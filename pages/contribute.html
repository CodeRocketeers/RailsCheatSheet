                            <p>This page is running on <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> so it is a pure html/css/js.<br />
                            Its content is loaded from a <a href="datasource.json">json file</a> located in the root of the page. If you want to contribute, create a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a>. The only thing you need to do is to update the <strong>datasource.json</strong> file. It's structure is pretty straightforward.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>id:</strong> - just increase the last one.</li>
                                <li><strong>title:</strong> - title of the sheet.</li>
                                <li><strong>content:</strong> - the content. Use html as you need. <strong>Do</strong> wrap the whole content to <i>&lt;p&gt;</i> (or make more of them). It is not wrapped automatically.</li>
                                <li><strong>imageUrl:</strong> - absolute path to your Github profile image. Not needed.</li>
                                <li><strong>commit:</strong> - edit version. If you are creating a new sheet, insert <strong>1</strong>. If you are editing exiting sheet, increase this number by 1.</li>
                                <li><strong>version:</strong> - if the command is specific for/from particular Rails version, put it here. If the command is comon for all versions, put <strong>any</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>emoticon:</strong> - anything short you want to share with others. Like <strong>:)</strong> or so. It is shown in the right top corner of the sheet in the gray field.</li>
                                <li><strong>categories:</strong> - string representation of categories. Choose wisely. A category filter in the right sidebar is created from all this categories.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
